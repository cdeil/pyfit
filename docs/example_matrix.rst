Show me how it works!
=====================

We have solved a range of typical modelling and fitting tasks with each Python package.
If you have a given task check out how to do it with a few of the available packages, then use the one you like most for your own work!

@todo: Each table entry should be a link to the corresponding rendered IPython notebook and as text we could put -- - 0 + ++ reflecting our evaluation how nice this problem can be solved with this package.

@todo: How to make the text for the problems vertical?
