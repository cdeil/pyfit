Modelling and Fitting in Python
===============================

What is this?
-------------

This is a survey / tutorial of existing Python modelling and fitting packages.

The goal is to help you to to quickly:

- learn modelling and fitting with `IPython <http://ipython.org>`_ `notebooks <http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/htmlnotebook.html>`_
- figure out the features and limitations of the many available packages.

We do hope that in the long run based on this comparison the available packages will grow more powerful and easy to use.

Please contribute via github issues or pull requests!

Where do I start?
-----------------

* Start by browsing the documentation on the web page, e.g. with the :ref:`introduction` or the (TODO: Straight line chi2 fit).
* If you want start fitting yourself, read :ref:`installation` on how to install the packages and get and run the IPython notebooks.
