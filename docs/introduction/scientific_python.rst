Scientific Computing with Python
--------------------------------

We do expect for pyfit that you have some `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ programming and `Scientific Python <http://scipy.github.com>`_ data analysis skills.

If you don't, this tutorial-style book is the best place to start:

* `"Python for Data Analysis" <http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do>`_ by `Wes McKinney <http://wesmckinney.com/blog/>`_

While you're waiting for the book to arrive, check out some of these great tutorials:

* http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/
* http://scipy-lectures.github.com
* http://python4astronomers.github.com
* http://software-carpentry.org/2012/06/tutorial-numpy-scipy-and-matplotlib/

If you prefer video tutorials, most talks and tutorials as the Scipy US and Europe conference were recorded in the last years. Unfortunately the video quality is often not good, so actually reading and following along with the tutorials above is probably more productive.
