Modelling and Fitting in Python
===============================

This is a survey / tutorial of existing Python modelling and fitting packages.

The goal is to help you to to quickly:
* figure out the features and limitations of the many available packages
* get started by reading and playing with an IPython notebook

If you want to model and fit your data in Python, go check out the documentation:
http://cdeil.github.com/python_modelling_fitting.github.com/dev/

If you're a developer for a Python modelling and fitting package you can
also consider this a shootout and see how you are doing compared to the competition:

We do hope that in the long run the available packages will grow more powerful and easy to use.
