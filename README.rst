Modelling and Fitting in Python
===============================

This is a survey / tutorial of existing Python modelling and fitting packages.

The goal is to help you to to quickly:

- figure out the features and limitations of the many available packages
- get started by reading and playing with an IPython notebook
- as a developer check out how your package compares to the competition

Web page:     http://pyfit.github.com

Shootout:     http://pyfit.github.com/feature_matrix.html

Mailing list: http://groups.google.com/group/pyfits

We do hope that in the long run the available packages will grow more powerful and easy to use.
